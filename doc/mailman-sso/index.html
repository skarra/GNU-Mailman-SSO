  <h1>Mailman Single SignOn (SSO) Customizations Summary</h1>

  The <a href="https://github.com/skarra/GNU-Mailman-SSO">SSO extension</a> to
  Mailman is meant for a Mailman installation for use within a closed group of
  users. This sort of an installation can be used to host a company's internal
  mailing lists used by employees, for e.g.

  The extension is a single additional CGI script that provides a small set of
  Mailman features.

  <h2>Key differences between the stock GNU Mailman
    and Mailman SSO? </h2>
  <p/>

  <ul>
    <li> Built for a intranet-type set up with single signon
    authentication </li>

    <li> List subscribe and unsubscribe are single click
      operations. </li>

    <li> There are no passwords to remember. You will not receive
      monthly reminders for each list you are subscribed to - because
      Mailman SSO takes care of this behind the scenes </li>

    <li> A lot of the GNU Mailman functionality is not
      exported. Many of the features will never be exposed. Others will be
      supported over time, for e.g. - private archives, subscribing in digest
      mode, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>

  This file contains screenshots of the four principal screens of the
  customized web interface.

  <h2> Home Screen:</h2> 

  <p>
    In our installation, access to the server is controlled through a single
    sign on authentication, and a cookie value is verified to establish
    credentials for access. The userid - value of the cookie - is displayed on
    the top right corner.

  </p>

  <h2> Subscriptions: </h2>

  <p>
    This is where all the advertised lists on the current server are
    listed. Folks can join or leave with a single click, and the status is
    updated instantly.

  </p>

  <h2> List Admin: </h2>

  <p>
    In this tab, one can create new lists, and manage lists that they own. The
    following screenshot is the default view - where all the lists that have the
    current user as the owner are listed in a table.

  </p>

  <p>
    The user can create a new list by clicking the green "Create new" link just
    below the table, and a form is displayed, like so:

  </p>

  <p>
     Clicking the name of any of the lists will open up a form below the table,
     and a small set of configuration variables can be edited.
