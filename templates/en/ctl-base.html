	<h2>
	  Welcome to <span class="mono"> lists.cleartrip.com </span>
	</h2>

	<p>

	  <span style="font-family: monospace;">lists.cleartrip.com</span>
	  serves as the central site for email lists used by various 
	  groups and projects in Cleartrip.

	  Use the navigation bar above to access the various features of the
	  list server. The functionality of each tab is explain in brief
	  below. You will also find guidelines, and some do's and dont's with
	  this basic but very functional collaboration resource.
	</p>

	<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
	<p>
	  This tab shows all available email lists on the server. You can get
	  details of every list by clicking on the list name, join any list
	  you choose to, or leave any list you are already on.

	  This list server is designed to be an open and freely accessible
	  resource.  In its current state all past messages are available in
	  archives. Links to the archives are available in the detailed list
	  view on this tab. Feel feel to browse around.
	</p>

	<h2>Lists Admin</h2>
	<p>
	  As mentioned earlier, this list server is designed to be an open and
	  freely accessible resource. Creating lists is a part of this
	  freedom. 

	  In this tab you can create new lists, and manage lists you are
	  already the owner for. You can edit details of lists, add/remove
	  subscribers automatically, etc.
	</p>

	<h2>Site Admin</h2>
	<p>
	  This tab is for the admins of this list server. So let's not go into
	  this one here.

	<h1> FAQs </h1>

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <qn>What is the software on which this list server
	    runs</qn> 
	    <p/>
	    
	    The short answer is we are running
	    a <a href="https://github.com/skarra/GNU-Mailman-SSO">
	    customized </a> version of
	    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html"> GNU
	    Mailman. </a>
	    <p/>

	    Here is the longer answer: The core mailing list functionality
	    of <span class="mono">list.cleartrip.com</span> is powered
	    by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html"> GNU
	    Mailman. </a> While GNU Mailman is a very stable and powerful list
	    server, it is too complex for our needs. The simple web interface
	    you see here was written specially for this implementation. The
	    source code of the customizations built on top of GNU Mailman
	    2.1.15, and known as Mailman SSO, is available
	    on <a href="https://github.com/skarra/GNU-Mailman-SSO">
	    github </a>
	  </li>
	  <p/>

	  <li>
	    <qn>What are the key differences between the stock GNU Mailman
	    and Mailman SSO? </qn>
	    <p/>

	    <ul>
	      <li> Built for a intranet-type set up. Understands the Cleartrip
	      account login cookie and enables functionality on that </li>

	      <li> List subscribe and unsubscribe are single click
	      operations. </li>

	      <li> There are no passwords to remember. You will not receive
	      monthly reminders for each list you are subscribed to - because
	      Mailman SSO takes care of this behind the scenes </li>

	      <li> A lot of the GNU Mailman functionality is not
	      exported. Many of the features will never be exposed. Others
	      will be supported over time, for e.g. - private lists, private
	      archives, subscribing in digest mode, etc.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <p/>

	  <li>
	    <qn>What is a private list?</qn> 
	    <p/>
	    
	    By default the Subscriptions tab shows all the mailing lists
	    available on this server, and anyone can browse the archives, or
	    join the list. If the membership or access to the archives need to
	    be controlled, then the list owner can mark a list as
	    'private'. The setting can be specified at the time of creation,
	    or modified later by the owner through the List Admin interface.
	    <p/>

	    On the Subscriptions tab, you will see all public mailing lists,
	    as well as any private mailing lists you are a member of.
	  </li>
	  <p/>

	  <li>
	    <qn>Are there any guidelines for creating new lists?</qn>
	    <p/>

	    <strong> General Guidelines </strong> <p/>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Use short but descriptive names for your lists </li>
	      <li> Provide a good description for others considering joining
	      your list. </li>
	    </ul>
	    <p/>

	    <strong> Guidelines for project related lists </strong> <p/>
	    It will be beneficial if we follow some general naming
	    conventions. The suggestions are best explained by some examples:
	    <ul>
	      <li> <span class="mono">sw-dev</span> for Small World
	      development issues, code review requests, etc.</li>

	      <li> <span class="mono">sw-qa</span> this is where the Small World
	      QA team hangs out </li>

	      <li> <span class="mono">sw-design</span> for Small World
	      UI and Design team</li>

	      <li> <span class="mono">sw-cs</span> this is where the Small
	      World public feedback forms will send the output. </li>

	      <li> <span class="mono">sw</span> This is where all the Small
	      World stake holders can be reached. This will include the PMs,
	      manager of the PM, the Engineering lead's manager, all the
	      devs, QA, design folks, marketing folks, etc.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p/>

	    <strong> Guidelines for other lists </strong> <p/>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Check the lists that already exist. Do not create a new
	      list when there is something similar already. </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <p/>

	  <li>
	    <qn>We already have Basecamp, Jira and Distribution Lists on the
	    email server. What is the need for this list server? </qn>
	    <p/>

	    These tools have a few issues. In no particular order: 

	    <ol>
	      <li> They are all centralized and 'official'. Adding or
		removing people to DLs, or creating a new DL, has to go
		through a bureaucratic, and non-scalable process. </li>

	      <li> The setup overhead is a barrier for enabling collaboration
		in short-lived projects that nevertheless need some IT
		support </li>

	      <li> None of them are really built for informal "networking" or
		collaboration that's not directly related to a specific
		Corporate-sanctioned Basecamp-blessed project. For e.g. an
		arts interest group, or a forum for discussing tricks of
		programming in Rails, etc.</li>

	      <li> Have you ever written a Message on Basecamp and felt what a
		chore it was to find and select all the people you wanted to be
		notified? Well, you are not alone. </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p/>

	    All in all, clearly we can do better than them, with a
	    decentralized collaboration tool that empowers us to do the right
	    thing, help us collaborate more effectivley, and do all that without
	    adding to the load on any support function.
	    <p/>

	    Sure, Mailing Lists are so-1990s-ish. But we think it will boost
	    the levels of interaction and cross-team collobration from what we
	    have today.
	  </li>
	</ol>
