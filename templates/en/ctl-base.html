	<h2>
	  Welcome to <span class="mono""> lists.cleartrip.com </span>
	</h2>

	<p>

	  <span style="font-family: monospace;">lists.cleartrip.com</span>
	  serves as the central site for email lists used by various 
	  groups and projects in Cleartrip.

	  Use the navigation bar above to access the various features of the
	  list server. The functionality of each tab is explain in brief
	  below. You will also find guidelines, and some do's and dont's with
	  this basic but very functional collaboration resource.
	</p>

	<h2>Viewing Lists</h2>
	<p>
	  The "View Lists" tab shows all available email lists. You can find a
	  brief description of each list's purpose in life, and you can
	  decided whether to subscribe or not. The same interface also allows
	  you to unsubscribe from any list you are already on. 

	  Your official email address - the one you used to authenticate
	  yourself when you came to the site - will be added to / removed from
	  the list.

	  This list server is designed to be an open and freely accessible
	  resource.  In its current state all past messages are available in
	  archives. Links to the archives are availblae next to the list
	  desriptions in this tab. Feel feel to browse around.
	</p>

	<h2>Create Lists</h2>
	<p>
	  As mentioned earlier, this list server is designed to be an open and
	  freely accessible resource. Creating lists is a part of this
	  freedom. Creation is a simple process, you will be marked as the
	  "owner" of lists you create. Being an owner does not really mean
	  much at the moment, but at a future date we will expose
	  functionality that will allow you to add/remove people to/from a
	  list and such administrative tasks.
	</p>

	<h2>Admin</h2>
	<p>
	  This tab is for the admins of the list server. So let's not go into
	  this one here.
	</p>
